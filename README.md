# Python Tic-Tac-Toe CLI

A command-line version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, playing against a computer opponent.

## Key Features
- **2D List Data Structure:** The board is managed as a matrix [3][3].
- **Input Validation:** Prevents overwriting moves or entering invalid inputs.
- **Game Logic:** Automatically detects win conditions (Rows, Columns, Diagonals) and draws.

## ℹ️ Note on Development
This project was developed as a logic exercise. Portions of the code logic and refactoring were refined with the assistance of AI tools to ensure best practices and clean syntax.

# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors CLI

A terminal-based logic game built to practice Python fundamentals immediately after passing my **PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer)** certification.

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to translate game rules into efficient Python code. It handles user input, generates randomized bot moves, and tracks scores across multiple rounds.

## 🧠 Key Python Concepts Applied
- **Dictionaries:** Used to map game rules (Key beats Value) instead of messy nested `if` statements.
- **Input Validation:** Implemented `while` loops and membership operators (`not in`) to handle invalid user inputs.
- **Scope Management:** Utilized global variables and functions to maintain a persistent scoreboard.

## 🤝 Credits
- **Logic & Development:** Ritvik Yalala
- **Mentorship:** Guided by my AI Code Mentor (logic refactoring and dictionary-mapping strategy).

## 🛠️ How to Play
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Run the script: `python RockPaperScissor_game.py`
3. Enter `0` at any time to quit.
